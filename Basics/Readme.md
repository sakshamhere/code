Problem Statement
Given the following JSON data - data.json


as the input with weight and height parameters of a person, we have to perform the following:
1) Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1, BMI Category and Health risk
from Table 1 of the person and add them as 3 new columns
2) Count the total number of overweight people using ranges in the column BMI Category
of Table 1, check this is consistent programmatically and add any other observations in
the documentation
3) Create build, tests to make sure the code is working as expected and this can later be
added to an automation build / testing / deployment pipeline
4) Write a solid production-grade Python3 Program to solve this problem, imagine this will
be used in-product for 1 million patients. We are only interested in a standalone
backend application, we are NOT expecting a UI, webpage, frontend, Mobile App,
microsite, docker, web app etc. Simple and clean solution. Feel free to explore and use
the standard Python libraries or any open source Python modules
5) Check in the documentation, configuration, code and tests into github and please email


Formula 1 - BMI
BMI(kg/m
2) = mass(kg) / height(m)
2
The BMI (Body Mass Index) in (kg/m
2
) is equal to the weight in kilograms (kg) divided by your
height in meters squared (m)
2
. For example, if you are 175cm (1.75m) in height and 75kg in
weight, you can calculate your BMI as follows: 75kg / (1.75m²) = 24.49kg/m²


Table 1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.
BMI Category BMI Range (kg/m2) Health risk
Underweight 18.4 and below Malnutrition risk
Normal weight 18.5 - 24.9 Low risk
Overweight 25 - 29.9 Enhanced risk
Moderately obese 30 - 34.9 Medium risk
Severely obese 35 - 39.9 High risk
Very severely obese 40 and above Very high risk
